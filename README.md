All right so into this repository we got some PHP code that might be useful for future projects.

In 'sistema' we got a storage management that i use as a test for a future ERP software, gotta be true that it suffers a lot with security issues (both 'sistema' and 'login_archive' suffers with it).

About 'sistema' i can be that fast on talking about it, it really as simples as it looks, oh i also used bootstrap to frontend for the first time, so imma bit proud of it, i love design and ux/ui.

So 'login_archive' i have something that i want to evolve and update as much as i can, to be safer and better to use, probably i will be pushing here a second version of it soon. So its a login system with
authentication and a forgot password system that sends an email message by API using PHPMailer, alright might the first time that i have used and actual API in a project, but that's it, for the forgot password
issue, i send a random password for an repair e-mail that is associated to an account on signup, and then the user get into the system, that i soon want to integrate it with the 'sistema' file.
